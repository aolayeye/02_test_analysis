Although descriptive analytics is important to
development of answers to some questions,
the value derived is in the way descriptive analytics

The goal is to leverage past information to forecast
possible future outcomes.

Types of Clustering:

1.	Hierarchical Clustering – Useful for organization data and the tree can be stopped at any level.
2.	Distribution-Based Clustering – Probability of belonging to a cluster decreases with distance from center.
3.	Density Based Clustering – High density of points are placed into clusters. Useful for low dimensional data
4.	Centroid Based Clustering – High efficiency and simpler clustering process but not the best when there are outliers.
